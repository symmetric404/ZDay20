[Note from repository maintainer]

All files have names found with them in the project MFA.
However, some file names do have slight alterations to prevent directory conflicts. (ie. Same name)

These files have either one or more of the following put into brackets next to their original name:
 - Place/Level Found
 - Type
 - State 

Example 1: image [LEVEL 2].png
Example 2: image [PISTOL].png
Example 3: image [WALKING].png

The rest of the file name is completely original.
