Dump of original source code and compiled executable for ZDay20. A game developed by Andrew Sum & Jess Bowers. Files recovered via wayback machine and https://andrewsum.com/

## Game Description

It's been 20 days since the zombies first appeared. Now, the only important aspect of your life is survival. Scientifically speaking, the undead can't live forever unless they continue to feed on humans... or so we hope.

Play one of two scenarios through the eyes of a ZDay survivor. Barricade yourself inside a tiny room and pray that you can last until tomorrow, or run out guns-a-blazing. It's up to you. But the end is near, so you may as well keep score. 

### Controls
- WASD or arrow keys - Movement (change control scheme in options)
- Left Mouse Button - Fire current weapon
- Right Mouse Button - Stab with knife (regardless of current weapon)
- 1 - Change current weapon to pistol
- 2 - Change current weapon to shotgun
## FAQ

#### What is this?

ZDay20 was a game developed by Andrew Sum & Jess Bowers in February 2010 for the 'Gamebuilder 20 Event Competition 2010'.

#### Where was this found?

ZDay20 is listed on Andrew's website (https://andrewsum.com/) however it is not linked for download.  I went on the Wayback Machine (https://archive.org/) and found the original directory it was uploaded to.  To my surprise, the files were still there.

#### Why are you uploading this here?

While the files are still on Andrew's website, it is not easy to access for most.  I decided to upload the files here just in case they either disapeared or someone else interested in them wanted to find them.
