DESCRIPTION
==================

It's been 20 days since the zombies first appeared. Now, the only important aspect of your life is survival. Scientifically speaking, the undead can't live forever unless they continue to feed on humans... or so we hope.

Play one of two scenarios through the eyes of a ZDay survivor. Barricade yourself inside a tiny room and pray that you can last until tomorrow, or run out guns-a-blazing. It's up to you. But the end is near, so you may as well keep score. 

Controls:
WASD or arrow keys - Movement (change control scheme in options)
Left Mouse Button - Fire current weapon
Right Mouse Button - Stab with knife (regardless of current weapon)
1 - Change current weapon to pistol
2 - Change current weapon to shotgun
